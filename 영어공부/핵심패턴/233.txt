--------- I'm ~
I'm kind of tired. 
I'm kind of excited.
I'm kind of happy.
I'm kind of nervous.
I'm kind of jealous.

I'm here to talk to you.
I'm here to study.
I'm here to work.
I'm here to help.
I'm here to relax.

I'm about to get going.
I'm about to head out.
I'm about to go to bed.
I'm about to finish up.
I'm about to be upset.

I'm dying to see you.
I'm dying to get one.
I'm dying to give it a shot.	(정말 한번 시도해 보고 싶어요)
I'm dying to taste that.	(정말 그걸 맛보고 싶어요)
I'm dying to see that movie.	(정말 그 영화 보고 싶어요)

I'm okay with anything.
I'm okay with the plan.
I'm okay with whatever you choose.
I'm okay with being alone.
I'm okay with how it turned out.

I'm ready to go.
I'm ready to order.
I'm ready to start.
I'm ready to go home.
I'm ready to make a choice.
